## Tavern Patron Generator


## Why do You Need the Tavern Patron Generator?

Have you ever been Dungeon Mastering your favorite Table-Top Role-Playing Game and your players want to talk to EVERY non-player character (NPC) they come across? Do you not have a plethora of NPCs at the ready? That's where the Tavern Patron Generator comes in. With this tool you can generate NPCs of common races from most fantasy TTRPGs. 

## What Makes an NPC?

This tool will provide you with a name, race & gender. To give the NPC some depth a "quirk" about them is also provided. For your virtual campaigns a random token from the matching race and gender is also provided.
